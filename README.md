Mental health is a critical yet often overlooked aspect of well-being. Many individuals struggle with stress, anxiety, and depression but hesitate to seek professional help due to stigma, cost, or lack of awareness.  

This project aims to provide accessible support through digital tools like mood tracking, chatbot and helpline resources. By leveraging technology, we offer a user-friendly platform that encourages self-care and mental well-being.  

We have also included verified helpline numbers and resources to guide users toward professional support when needed. Our goal is to bridge the gap in mental health support and empower users with resources to manage their emotions effectively.
